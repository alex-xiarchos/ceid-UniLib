> This repository contains my university coursework for Software Enginnering.

UniLib is a software designed for the digitalization of physical university libraries. It provides students and academic staff the chance
to borrow and reserve books online, and on the other hand it helps the library staff to keep track of library's books and their transactions,
as well as library's users.
